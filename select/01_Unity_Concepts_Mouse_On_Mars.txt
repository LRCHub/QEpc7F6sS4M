One takes, yeah, If one takes another three as a preposition...

Which qualities does the one have?
One, the one.
The one that is itself and remains
The one that is different from all others and remains
The one
The one that if it is seen with others, it is in the position to become more, than one
Yet remains, one

With such simple songs...

With such simple songs...
It's like
One plus one plus one never ending
The connection loses itself where it cannot exist without a representation to the production and maintenance of its own wholeness
And it maintains itself only by recurring on that border, or extremity that is the extremity, or border, of its own dissapearance
