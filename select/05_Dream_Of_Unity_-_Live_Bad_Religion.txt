I had a dream of unity
Where we would walk side by side
But today I see that it's only me
Just trying to get by

Sometimes we stride undeterred
To walk as one toward our goal
But as people stray towards more selfish ways
We see we have no control

I had a dream of unity
Where we would walk side by side
But today I see that it's only me
Just trying to get by, just trying to get by
