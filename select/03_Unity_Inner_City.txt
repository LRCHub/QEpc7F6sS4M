"The Unity Of God"

I cannot blind you to die
You alone master side your fix
But surrender to me and talk of your death
Your death show be eternal memory
My altar a wish, your sacrifice.
Do not fear to bear
Your memory show be the mortal
You must come to me
Sup posting that you die there
And death would be the wise a peace
In mortality show be yours
But surrender to me
And talk of your death who liver of the lifes
After fact full forever my corner
Gazing who wish be your name fuck your storm!
Fear in the heart

...

You don't know to feel in mortality
Because I have to know everything

Eternal...

If you want... You're nothing never mind
If I'll to wish all completely
Destroyed all life in the world...
I will to end continuously
